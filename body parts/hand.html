The raccoon is usually described as having "hands" though opposable thumbs are lacking.[1]

Some evolutionary anatomists use the term hand to refer to the appendage of digits on the forelimb more generally â€” for example, in the context of whether the three digits of the bird hand involved the same homologous loss of two digits as in the dinosaur hand.[2]
